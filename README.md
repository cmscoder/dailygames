# DailyGames 🎮

Welcome to DailyGames! This is a web project built with Next.js, designed to offer a collection of daily games and puzzles — perfect for a quick and fun daily challenge.

## ✨ Features

- **Daily Challenges:** Engage with a new game or puzzle every day.
- **Variety of Games:** Explore different types of brain teasers and quick games.
- **Responsive Design:** Enjoy games seamlessly across various devices.
- **Fast and Modern UI:** Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

This project is built with the following technologies:

- **Next.js:** The React Framework for Production, enabling server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and API routes.
- **React:** A declarative, component-based JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:** A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Geist:** The Vercel font family, optimized with `next/font` for performance and aesthetics.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project leverages the **Next.js App Router** architecture, which provides a powerful and flexible way to build modern web applications. Key architectural aspects include:

- **Component-Based Development:** The UI is composed of reusable React components, promoting modularity and maintainability.
- **File-system Based Routing:** Routes are defined by the folder structure within the `/app` directory, simplifying navigation and organization.
- **Server Components (Optional):** Next.js App Router supports React Server Components, allowing for enhanced performance by rendering parts of the UI on the server.
- **API Routes:** The `/app/api` directory allows for the creation of backend API endpoints directly within the Next.js application, facilitating full-stack development.
- **Optimized Asset Management:** Static assets are served efficiently from the `/public` directory, and fonts are optimized using `next/font`.
